# üõ¢Ô∏è OIL WELL PROFITABILITY PREDICTION (REGIONAL ANALYSIS)

## Overview
A machine learning project designed to identify the **most profitable and least risky region** for new oil well development.  
Using geological data from three potential regions, the model predicts oil reserves and evaluates profit, risk, and investment feasibility.

**Goal:** Select the optimal region for drilling based on expected profit and risk analysis.  
**Best Region:** üèÜ Region 1 ‚Äî highest average profit, lowest RMSE, and minimal loss risk.

## Functionality
- Loads and analyzes geological data from three oil regions.  
- Trains a **Linear Regression model** to predict oil reserves.  
- Calculates **RMSE** for model accuracy per region.  
- Simulates profit from the **top 200 predicted wells** per region.  
- Uses **bootstrapping** to assess average profit, confidence intervals, and loss probability.  
- Recommends the best region for drilling based on profitability and stability.

---

## Key Insights
- **Region 1** demonstrated the lowest RMSE (**0.89**) and most consistent predictions.  
- **Regions 0 and 2** had higher RMSEs (‚âà 37.7 and 40.1), indicating greater variability.  
- The **minimum viable reserve** to avoid loss was **111.1 thousand barrels**.  
- Bootstrapping analysis confirmed **Region 1** offers the **highest average profit** with the **lowest financial risk**.

## Results
| Region | RMSE | Risk of Loss | Profitability |
|---------|------|--------------|----------------|
| Region 0 | 37.69 | Moderate | Variable |
| **Region 1** | **0.89** | **Low** | **Most Profitable** |
| Region 2 | 40.08 | Moderate‚ÄìHigh | Unstable |
